# Using the CABIN method for ATLAS photon identification

Workspace for optimizing ATLAS photon ID cuts using the CABIN method.  The CABIN method is implemented in the [cabin python package](https://github.com/scipp-atlas/cabin), available [on pypi](https://pypi.org/project/cabin/).

## Previous work

This code drew from previous examples in the [cabin-notebooks repository](https://github.com/scipp-atlas/cabin-notebooks/), including a fork that Scott Phillips used for his senior thesis work: [`CABIN_photonselection.ipynb`](https://github.com/ScottieJPhillips/CABIN/blob/main/CABIN_photonselection.ipynb).

## Setup

To get this going on the UChicago cluster, for example:

```
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install cabin xmltodict
```
